# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning model to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease using texture features from handwritten images. Extracted features with LBP and HOG, and used a Random Forest classifier for prediction. Built a simple web interface for image upload and result display.
